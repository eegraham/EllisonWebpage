			<h3>About</h3>
			<div>
				<p id="about">I grew up in Alabama and have deep Southern roots. I went to college at the University of Alabama where I got my BS in English with a minor in Spanish. I continued my studies at UA to get my MLIS. After I graduated I moved to Colorado and got the travel bug. I have lived in Bocas del Toro, Panama; Denver, CO; Winter Park, CO; Firestone, CO; Powers, OR; Portland, OR; Philadelphia, PA. My next move is to Asheville, NC where I'm planning to stick around for awhile.
